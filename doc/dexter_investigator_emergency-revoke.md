## dexter investigator emergency-revoke

Emergency revoke a dexter investigator

### Synopsis


This command instructs all dexter daemons to remove an investigator
from their local list.  It also deletes all previous reports for an
investigator.  It can be used to revoke an investigator's ability to
create, approve, or access investigations in an emergency.

WARNING: This should only be used when there is fear that an investigator
is compromised.  To remove an investigator under normal circumstances,
simply delete the investigator file, prune reports, and redeploy all
dexter daemons.
